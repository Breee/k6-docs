    The APIs provided by this jslib operate synchronously, which means k6 must
    wait for operations that use the client classes to finish before proceeding
    with the rest of the script.
    <p>
      In some cases, such as downloading large files from S3, this could affect
      performance and test results. To minimize the impact on test performance,
      we recommend using these operations in the
      <span className="code-inline">setup</span> and{' '}
      <span className="code-inline">teardown</span>{' '}
      <a href="/docs/using-k6/test-lifecycle/">lifecycle functions</a>. These
      functions run before and after the test run and thus do not influence test
      results.
